<h2 id="140342937457568overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Redis is used as a distributed cache for SAS Viya platform services. This README file describes the settings available for deploying the Redis Operator.</p>
<h2 id="140342937457568installation">Installation</h2>
<p>You can customize your Redis instance for your SAS Viya platform deployment by adding a transformer. Example transformers have been provided and are described below. Based on these descriptions, you can determine whether you want to customize your Redis deployment. </p>
<p>If you decide to add a transformer, copy the example file that you have selected and save it in your site-config directory.</p>
<p>Each file contains information about its content. The variables in the file are set
off by curly braces and spaces, such as {{ PRIMARY-COUNT }}. Replace the
entire variable string, including the braces, with the value you want to use.</p>
<p>After you have edited the file, add a reference to it in the transformers block
of the base kustomization.yaml file (<code>$deploy/kustomization.yaml</code>). Here is an
example:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml">transformers:
...
- site-config/redis/operator/redis-disable-persistence.yaml
- site-config/redis/operator/redis-modify-cluster-replicas.yaml
- site-config/redis/operator/redis-modify-server-config.yaml
- site-config/redis/operator/redis-modify-storage.yaml</code></pre>

<h2 id="140342937457568examples">Examples</h2>
<p>The example files are located at <code>$deploy/sas-bases/examples/redis/operator</code>.
The following list contains a description of each example file for Redis Operator settings
and the file names.</p>
<ul>
<li>modify the persistent storage allocation and class (redis-modify-storage.yaml)</li>
<li>modify the cluster replica count (redis-modify-cluster-replicas.yaml)</li>
<li>disable persistence (redis-disable-persistence.yaml)</li>
</ul>
