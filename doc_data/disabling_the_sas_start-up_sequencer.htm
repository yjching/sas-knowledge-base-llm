<h2 id="140342937700000overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The SAS Start-Up Sequencer is configured to start pods in an predetermined, ordered sequence to ensure that pods are efficiently and effectively
started in a manner that improves startup time.   This design ensures that certain components start before others and allows Kubernetes to pull container Images in a
priority-based sequence.  It also provides a degree of resource optimization, in that resources are more efficiently spent during SAS Viya platform start-up with a
priority given to starting essential components first.</p>
<p>However, there may be cases where this optimization is not desired by an administrator.  For these cases, we provide the ability to disable this feature
by applying a transformer that updates the components in your cluster that prevents the start sequencer functionality from executing. </p>
<h2 id="140342937700000installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Add <code>sas-bases/overlays/startup/disable-startup-transformer.yaml</code> to the transformers block in your base kustomization.yaml (<code>$deploy/kustomization.yaml</code>) file.  Ensure that ordered-startup-transformer.yaml is listed after <code>sas-bases/overlays/required/transformers.yaml</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml">...
transformers:
...
- sas-bases/overlays/required/transformers.yaml
- sas-bases/overlays/startup/disable-startup-transformer.yaml</code></pre>
